# Miun Courses frontend

The solution for the miun-courses web app (frontend) in the Web Development with Javascript course (DT190G).

## Branches

Before you start working on your solution of an laboration it's important that you create and check out a new branch. All branches must be named according to the format `labX` where `X` is replaced with the corresponding section number:

0. Intro (JSON)
1. Node.js
2. MongoDB
3. Angular 

## Workflow

Make sure you have checked out the correct lab branch. Make small commits regularly during development.

When you are done with the solution for a laboration, switch back to the master branch and merge all changes in the lab branch. This will make the master branch always contain the solution for the most recent laboration, still keeping the solution for all previous laborations.

Do _not_ delete the lab branches! These will be used when your solution is assessed.
